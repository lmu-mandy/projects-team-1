# Project Name

A project by Kevin Marinshaw, David Donovan, and Joseph Ortiz for CMSI 5370

Welcome to our project **REDACTED**. In order to run these programs, you will need to...

1. Run `python Preprocess.py` (depending on your memory in your machine you may want to adjust the amount of the dataset you use to test and train your models. this can be found on line 25 of preprocess.py)
2. Run either `python Baseline.py` or `python NN.py` to train and test the models.
